  "summary": "I am an innovative problem-solver dedicated to driving societal impact through cutting-edge research and scalable software systems. With a strong foundation in software development, human-robot interaction, and interdisciplinary applied AI research, I specialize in building robust, user-centric systems that bridge technology with real-world use cases. My work spans social robotics, full-stack engineering, AI systems, and large-scale software design.\n\nAt the Social and Intelligent Robotics Research Lab (SIRRL), I build software applications for robots in speech therapy, integrating conversational AI, speech data analysis, and interactive system design to enhance therapeutic effectiveness. At the Vector Institute, I contributed to applied AI programs through RAG pipeline development, agentic AI workflows, and delivery execution for 25+ startups.\n\nBefore that, I spent 5 years at HPE Aruba as a Software Engineer, delivering secure, large-scale backend systems and contributing to feature releases impacting thousands of enterprise clients. I enjoy building meaningful technology—AI tools, robotics systems, backend platforms, and products that help real people.",
