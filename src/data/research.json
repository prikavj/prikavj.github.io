    "description": "This study explores the integration of social robots into stuttering therapy sessions for preschoolers. Through interviews and observations with Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs), the research identifies practical applications and design considerations for human-robot interactions in clinical settings. Key findings suggest that social robots can engage children through interactive games and provide consistent speech models, with interactions being structured and supervised by SLPs.",
